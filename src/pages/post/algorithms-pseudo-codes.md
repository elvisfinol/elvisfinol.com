## SEARCHING ALGORITHMS

#### BINARY SEARCH
```
binarySearch(input, searchValue) {
    lower = 0
    upper = input.len - 1

    white(upper >= lower) {
        mid = (upper + lower) / 2

        if (input[mid] == searchValue)
        return True
        elif (searchValue < input[mid])
        upper = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    }
    return false
}
```

#### LINEAR SEARCH
```
linearSearch(input, searchValue) {
    for (i=0 to input.lenght - 1) {
        if (input[i] == searchValue)
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```

#### JUMP SEARCH
```
# Python3 code to implement Jump Search
import math

def jumpSearch( arr , x , n ):
	
	# Finding block size to be jumped
	step = math.sqrt(n)
	
	# Finding the block where element is
	# present (if it is present)
	prev = 0
	while arr[int(min(step, n)-1)] < x:
		prev = step
		step += math.sqrt(n)
		if prev >= n:
			return -1
	
	# Doing a linear search for x in
	# block beginning with prev.
	while arr[int(prev)] < x:
		prev += 1
		
		# If we reached next block or end
		# of array, element is not present.
		if prev == min(step, n):
			return -1
	
	# If element is found
	if arr[int(prev)] == x:
		return prev
	
	return -1

# Driver code to test function
arr = [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,
	34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610 ]
x = 55
n = len(arr)

# Find the index of 'x' using Jump Search
index = jumpSearch(arr, x, n)

# Print the index where 'x' is located
print("Number" , x, "is at index" ,"%.0f"%index)


```

## SORTING ALGORITHMS 

#### BUBBLE SORT
```
# Python program for implementation of Bubble Sort

def bubbleSort(arr):
	n = len(arr)

	# Traverse through all array elements
	for i in range(n-1):
	# range(n) also work but outer loop will repeat one time more than needed.

		# Last i elements are already in place
		for j in range(0, n-i-1):

			# traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
			# Swap if the element found is greater
			# than the next element
			if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
				arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Driver code to test above
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

bubbleSort(arr)

print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
	print ("%d" %arr[i]),
```

#### INSERTION SORT
```
# Python program for implementation of Insertion Sort

# Function to do insertion sort
def insertionSort(arr):

	# Traverse through 1 to len(arr)
	for i in range(1, len(arr)):

		key = arr[i]

		# Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are
		# greater than key, to one position ahead
		# of their current position
		j = i-1
		while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :
				arr[j+1] = arr[j]
				j -= 1
		arr[j+1] = key


# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertionSort(arr)
print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
	print ("%d" %arr[i])

```

#### SELECTION SORT
```
# Python program for implementation of Selection
# Sort
import sys
A = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]

# Traverse through all array elements
for i in range(len(A)):
	
	# Find the minimum element in remaining
	# unsorted array
	min_idx = i
	for j in range(i+1, len(A)):
		if A[min_idx] > A[j]:
			min_idx = j
			
	# Swap the found minimum element with
	# the first element		
	A[i], A[min_idx] = A[min_idx], A[i]

# Driver code to test above
print ("Sorted array")
for i in range(len(A)):
	print("%d" %A[i]),
```

#### HEAP SORT
```
# Python program for implementation of heap Sort

# To heapify subtree rooted at index i.
# n is size of heap
def heapify(arr, n, i):
	largest = i # Initialize largest as root
	l = 2 * i + 1	 # left = 2*i + 1
	r = 2 * i + 2	 # right = 2*i + 2

	# See if left child of root exists and is
	# greater than root
	if l < n and arr[i] < arr[l]:
		largest = l

	# See if right child of root exists and is
	# greater than root
	if r < n and arr[largest] < arr[r]:
		largest = r

	# Change root, if needed
	if largest != i:
		arr[i],arr[largest] = arr[largest],arr[i] # swap

		# Heapify the root.
		heapify(arr, n, largest)

# The main function to sort an array of given size
def heapSort(arr):
	n = len(arr)

	# Build a maxheap.
	# Since last parent will be at ((n//2)-1) we can start at that location.
	for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):
		heapify(arr, n, i)

	# One by one extract elements
	for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
		arr[i], arr[0] = arr[0], arr[i] # swap
		heapify(arr, i, 0)

# Driver code to test above
arr = [ 12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
heapSort(arr)
n = len(arr)
print ("Sorted array is")
for i in range(n):
	print ("%d" %arr[i]),

```

#### QUICK SORT
```
# Python program for implementation of Quicksort Sort

# This function takes last element as pivot, places
# the pivot element at its correct position in sorted
# array, and places all smaller (smaller than pivot)
# to left of pivot and all greater elements to right
# of pivot


def partition(arr, low, high):
	i = (low-1)		 # index of smaller element
	pivot = arr[high]	 # pivot

	for j in range(low, high):

		# If current element is smaller than or
		# equal to pivot
		if arr[j] <= pivot:

			# increment index of smaller element
			i = i+1
			arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

	arr[i+1], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[i+1]
	return (i+1)

# The main function that implements QuickSort
# arr[] --> Array to be sorted,
# low --> Starting index,
# high --> Ending index

# Function to do Quick sort


def quickSort(arr, low, high):
	if len(arr) == 1:
		return arr
	if low < high:

		# pi is partitioning index, arr[p] is now
		# at right place
		pi = partition(arr, low, high)

		# Separately sort elements before
		# partition and after partition
		quickSort(arr, low, pi-1)
		quickSort(arr, pi+1, high)


# Driver code to test above
arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]
n = len(arr)
quickSort(arr, 0, n-1)
print("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(n):
	print("%d" % arr[i]),
```


#### MERGE SORT
```
# Python program for implementation of MergeSort

# Merges two subarrays of arr[].
# First subarray is arr[l..m]
# Second subarray is arr[m+1..r]
def merge(arr, l, m, r):
	n1 = m - l + 1
	n2 = r- m

	# create temp arrays
	L = [0] * (n1)
	R = [0] * (n2)

	# Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
	for i in range(0 , n1):
		L[i] = arr[l + i]

	for j in range(0 , n2):
		R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j]

	# Merge the temp arrays back into arr[l..r]
	i = 0	 # Initial index of first subarray
	j = 0	 # Initial index of second subarray
	k = l	 # Initial index of merged subarray

	while i < n1 and j < n2 :
		if L[i] <= R[j]:
			arr[k] = L[i]
			i += 1
		else:
			arr[k] = R[j]
			j += 1
		k += 1

	# Copy the remaining elements of L[], if there
	# are any
	while i < n1:
		arr[k] = L[i]
		i += 1
		k += 1

	# Copy the remaining elements of R[], if there
	# are any
	while j < n2:
		arr[k] = R[j]
		j += 1
		k += 1

# l is for left index and r is right index of the
# sub-array of arr to be sorted
def mergeSort(arr,l,r):
	if l < r:

		# Same as (l+r)//2, but avoids overflow for
		# large l and h
		m = (l+(r-1))//2

		# Sort first and second halves
		mergeSort(arr, l, m)
		mergeSort(arr, m+1, r)
		merge(arr, l, m, r)


# Driver code to test above
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
n = len(arr)
print ("Given array is")
for i in range(n):
	print ("%d" %arr[i]),

mergeSort(arr,0,n-1)
print ("\n\nSorted array is")
for i in range(n):
	print ("%d" %arr[i]),
```
